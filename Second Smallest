Question:
For given array find out the second smallest element.
Constraints:no
Input format:
Line 1: Integer (Size of array)
Line 2 Elements
Output format:
Integer
Example:
Sample Input:1
5
21435
Sample Output:2
2
Code:

# Input the size of the array
n = int(input())

# Input the elements of the array
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize variables to store the smallest and second smallest elements
smallest = float('inf')  # Set to positive infinity initially
second_smallest = float('inf')  # Set to positive infinity initially

# Iterate through the array to find the smallest and second smallest elements
for num in arr:
    if num < smallest:
        second_smallest = smallest
        smallest = num
    elif num < second_smallest and num != smallest:
        second_smallest = num

# Check if a second smallest element was found
if second_smallest == float('inf'):
    print("There is no second smallest element in the array.")
else:
    print(second_smallest)
