Question:
Unique characters
Given two strings $1 and $2 Modify string 51 such that all the common characters of $1 and 52 is to be removed and the uncommon characters of $1 and $2 is to be concatenated. Otherwise print '-1'.
Constraints:no
Input format:
2 Strings
Output format String:

Example:
Sample Input 1:
acdb
gafd
Sample Output1:
cbgf
Sample Output 2:
1
Explanation:
In first test case 2 strings were given and all the comman elemenets from the two strings were eliminated and only unique characters are given as output
In second testcase only 1 string was given so 1 is the output
Sample Input 2:
abc

Code:

def modify_strings(s1, s2):
    set1 = set(s1)
    set2 = set(s2)
    common_chars = set1.intersection(set2)
    # Remove common characters from both strings
    unique_s1 = ''.join(c for c in s1 if c not in common_chars)
    unique_s2 = ''.join(c for c in s2 if c not in common_chars)
    
    # If both resulting strings are empty, it means there are no unique characters
    if unique_s1 == '' and unique_s2 == '':
        return -1
    
    # Concatenate the unique characters from both strings
    result = unique_s1 + unique_s2    
    return result
# Input strings
s1 = input("Enter the first string: ")
s2 = input("Enter the second string: ")
# Call the function to modify the strings
result = modify_strings(s1, s2)
# Check if the result is -1 and print accordingly
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(result)
